### This is Elon Musk inciting violence. He’s not hiding it. It’s not subtle.  It’s plain and simple incitement. ###

### Noch immer jemand der Meinung, man könne die gegenwärtige Entwicklung in USA nicht mit D ab 1933 vergleichen?

  * Obdachlose als lebensunwert umbringen zu wollen ist nun wirklich nicht mehr unterscheidbar
  * Fox host Brian Kilmeade, on Fox & Friends, suggested “involuntary lethal injection” for mentally ill homeless people, adding “just kill them,” during a segment on homelessness.

### Sophie’s Stand: The White Rose’s Call 
I am Sophia Magdalena Scholl, born May 9, 1921, in Forchtenberg, Germany. Raised in a Lutheran family—Father Robert, a principled mayor; Mother Magdalena, our moral compass; with five siblings, including Hans, my closest ally—I was a spirited child, drawn to art and nature. At twelve, I joined the Bund Deutscher Mädel, seduced by its sense of belonging, but by sixteen, I saw its lies. In 1937, Hans and friends were arrested for youth group activities; I was briefly detained, my eyes opening to the regime’s cruelty.
After graduating in 1940, I worked as a kindergarten teacher, then endured Reich Labor Service in 1941, witnessing Nazi exploitation firsthand. In May 1942, I entered the University of Munich, studying biology and philosophy alongside Hans. With friends Alexander Schmorell, Christoph Probst, and Willi Graf, we formed the White Rose, a resistance group rooted in conscience. Inspired by banned poets, scripture, and reports of mass murders, we wrote leaflets urging Germans to resist: “We will not be silent!” As a woman, I moved freely, distributing pamphlets across cities.
Our sixth leaflet, February 1943, decried Stalingrad’s defeat and called for rebellion. On February 18, Hans and I scattered copies at the university. A custodian, Jakob Schmid, betrayed us. Arrested by the Gestapo, I faced grueling interrogations, claiming sole responsibility to protect others. Tried with Hans and Christoph before Roland Freisler’s People’s Court, we were sentenced to death. On February 22, 1943, at twenty-one, I faced the guillotine in Stadelheim Prison, saying, “How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to give himself up individually?”
Our final leaflet, smuggled out, was dropped by Allied planes. Today, we are honored in Germany’s memory.
Anne’s diary, smuggled through underground networks, reaches me here, its courage fueling my leaflets. My cry, in turn, calls to Dietrich, linking our rebellion to his sacred resistance.

### Stephen Miller: 
"The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven was he said that we have to dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence. That was the last message that he sent me ... we are gonna do that."

### Sane person:
The scary part of weaponizing religion for politics is this: if you agree, it’s ‘God’s will,’ but if you don’t, it’s treated as heresy. Faith twisted into a tool for power, division, and control isn’t belief anymore, it’s fanaticism.
